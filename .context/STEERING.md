# PLAN

## Objective
- Rebuild `bb` as a Rust-first Bitbucket Cloud CLI with a `gh`-like structure.
- Keep the public binary name `bb`.
- Complete phase 1 with Rust MVP parity for the documented command set only.

## Phases
1. Rust migration reset (scope, plan/task tracker, docs baseline).
2. Rust workspace bootstrap (`bb-cli` + `bb-core`) and shared foundations.
3. MVP command port (`auth`, `api`, `repo`, `pr`, `pipeline`, `issue`, `wiki`, `completion`, `version`).
4. Rust-only validation, release workflow conversion, and Go removal.

## Success Criteria
- Rust workspace builds and tests cleanly with Cargo.
- The documented Cloud MVP commands are implemented in Rust and verified.
- Config precedence, auth modes, repo inference, pagination, and output modes match the documented contract.
- CI and release workflows build Rust artifacts named `bb`.
- Go entrypoints and Go-only workflows are removed after Rust verification passes.

## Current Phase
- Phase: Rust CLI/runtime module refactor completed
- Owner: Main
- Tracking: [GitHub issue #38](https://github.com/azyu/bb-cli/issues/38)
- Notes: CLI parsing and runtime execution are split into cohesive command-domain modules. The v0.2.7 command contracts and runtime behavior remain covered by 130 passing workspace tests.
